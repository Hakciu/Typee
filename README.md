This application is designed to aid in learning touch typing quickly. It features an adaptive algorithm that supports learning by increasing the occurrence of letters that users find challenging. The application supports multiple languages, including Polish, English, German, Spanish, and French, allowing users to practice in their native language or learn new ones. Users can track their progress through charts, providing a visual representation of their improvement over time. Typee has been developed as an engineering project and utilizes Vue 3 and Supabase for its development, offering a modern, reactive user interface and a robust backend database solution.
